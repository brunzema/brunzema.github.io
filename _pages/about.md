Hi there! Since March 2022, I am a PhD student at the [Institute for Data Science in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~ibtrg/DSME/lidx/1/) at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1) under the supervision of [Sebastian Trimpe](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/DSME/Das-Institut/Team/~jlolt/Prof-Sebastian-Trimpe/?allou=1), and since September 2023 I am an associate doctoral researcher at the [UnRAVel Research Training Group](https://www.unravel.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/ofgh/?lidx=1) funded by the [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp).

Prior to that, I completed a bachelor's degree in **mechanical engineering** and a subsequent master's degree in **automation engineering** with a focus on machine learning and control, both at the [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1).
During my studies, I received the [Germany Scholarship](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/Wirtschaft/Fundraising/~elu/Bildungsfonds/?lidx=1), a [MathWorks Fellowship](https://www.irt.rwth-aachen.de/global/show_document.asp?id=aaaaaaaaaavkdoz), and was selected repeatedly for [RWTH Aachen University's Dean's List](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/Studium/Lehre/Exzellente-Lehre/~dhky/Dean-s-List/?lidx=1). For my master thesis under supervision from [Alexander von Rohr](https://thisisalex.de/) on parameter search in time-varying environments using Bayesian optimization I received the [SEW-EURODRIVE Student Award](https://www.sew-eurodrive-stiftung.de/en/#student-award).

My current research evolves around uncertainty quanitifaction when learning system dynamics and detecting changes in system dynamics with probabilistic quarantees. Furthermore, I am interested in Bayesian optimization--specifically in high-dimensional and time-varying approaches.
