I participated in the [AI for Robotics Workshop](https://www.ai4robotics.eu/) which included very interesting presentations from leading researchers at the intersection of robotics and AI. Furthermore, it gave me the opportunity to talk (among others) to [Francesco Nori](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t3l8q6gAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Roberto Calandra](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=fA0rYxMAAAAJ&hl=en).
