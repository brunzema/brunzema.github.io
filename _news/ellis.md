I attended the [Cambridge Ellis Unit Summer School on Probabilistic Machine Learning 2023](https://www.ellis.eng.cam.ac.uk/cambridge-ellis-unit-summer-school-on-probabilistic-machine-learning-2023-a-success/) where I got the opportunity to discuss research (and drink a few beers :beers:) with super talented PhD students from all over Europe.
